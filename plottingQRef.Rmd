# About
## About This Document

This document provides brief explanations of the plotting functions available in Base R and the lattice package. It does not cover the [tidyverse or ggplot](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) - Rstudio does a great job of that without my help.

# plot

[Instructional video on plot()](https://linkedin-learning.pxf.io/plot)

The simplest of all plots

```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(ChickWeight$Time,ChickWeight$weight)
```


Change the appearance of the plotted points
```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(ChickWeight$Time,ChickWeight$weight,type = "l")
```

setting the titles and labels

```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(ChickWeight$Time,ChickWeight$weight,
     type = "l",
     main = "Plot for R Example",
     sub = "We are learning a little at a time",
     xlab="number of days since birth",
     ylab="grams of body weight")
```



add another line to a plot
```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(ChickWeight$Time,ChickWeight$weight,
     type = "l",
     main = "Plot for R Example",
     sub = "We are learning a little at a time",
     xlab="number of days since birth",
     ylab="grams of body weight")

lines(c(1,20),c(350,50))

```


change the appearance of the graph
```{r, echo=TRUE}

plot(ChickWeight$Time,ChickWeight$weight,
     type = "l",
     main = "Plot for R Example",
     sub = "We are learning a little at a time",
     xlab="number of days since birth",
     ylab="grams of body weight")
lines(c(1,20),c(350,50), type="o", pch=22, lty=2, col="red")

```


You can also use functions as x and y arguments

```{r, echo=TRUE}
some.values <- function(my.something) { 
  return(seq(from=1, to=100,length.out = length(my.something))^2)
  }
plot(mtcars$mpg,some.values(mtcars$mpg))

```


Here's a clever trick - put a plot in a function
```{r, echo=TRUE}

plotThis <- function(lineX,lineY) {plot(mtcars$mpg,
     type = "b",
     main = "Plot for R Example",
     sub = "We are learning a little at a time",
     xlab="mpg is Miles Per Gallon",
     ylab="Look at the pretty bumps")
lines(lineX,lineY)
}
plotThis(c(5,30),c(15,30))

plotThis(c(15,30),c(25,5))

```




# conditional density plot

Suppose you are doing research: given a certain amount of time, how much should a chick weigh?

```{r echo=TRUE}

       main = "How much should a chick weigh?",

# can you say "overplotting"
cdplot(factor(weight) ~ Time, data = ChickWeight)

# let's fix the overplot with cut()
cdplot(factor(cut(weight, 6, labels = 1:6 * 62)) ~ Time, 
       data = ChickWeight,
