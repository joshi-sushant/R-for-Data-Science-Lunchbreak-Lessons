# Description: 

# dput will write an R language version of an object to disk
dput(ChickWeight, file = "chickweight_dput.R")
# includes meta data

# compare to save
save(ChickWeight, file = "chickweight_save.rds")
# save creates a binary version of the file

# file.write would create a csv
write.csv(ChickWeight, file = "chickweight_writecsv.csv")
# does not include meta data or ability to buid the file programmatically 

# retrieve a dput file.
# either run the dput code
# ... or ...
newChickWeight <- dget(file = "chickweight_dput.R")


# dput & dget might not work. Use save and load to transfer R objects
