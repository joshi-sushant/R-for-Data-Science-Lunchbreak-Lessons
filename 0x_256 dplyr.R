# a package for data manipulation
# part of the tidyverse

# mutate() adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
# select() picks variables based on their names.
# filter() picks cases based on their values.
# summarise() reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
# arrange() changes the ordering of the rows.
# These all combine naturally with group_by() which allows you to perform any operation “by group”.
